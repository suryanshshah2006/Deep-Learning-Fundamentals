# Deep-Learning-Fundamentals
This repository contains a collection of foundational projects in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, showcasing my journey from basic classification to regularization techniques.

📂 Projects Included

1. Handwritten Digit Classification (MNIST)

Goal: Classify 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9).

Tech: Simple ANN, Flattening layers, Softmax/Sigmoid activation.

Highlight: Used TensorBoard for monitoring training curves and loss.

2. Dog vs. Cat Classification

Goal: Binary classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Optimization: Used Batch Normalization and Dropout Regularization to reduce overfitting.

3. Sonar Mines vs. Rocks Classification

Goal: Classifying sonar returns from a metal cylinder vs. a rock.

Tech: Dense Neural Networks with Dropout layers.

4. Transfer Learning Experiments

Goal: Leveraging pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet50) for improved accuracy on smaller datasets.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
